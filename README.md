# MIS-381N

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/fda/adverse-food-events

Question: 

What are the biggest predictors of food-related severe outcomes, including required intervention, hospitalization, death, life-threatening conditions, disability, serious injuries, and other medical problems? 

Importance of the Question: 

-Put some statistic about how many people die from food allergies each year or have some major suffering <br>
-Can predict what providers need to look out for in symptoms in like E.R. to take care of those who will probably die first/have serious repercussions -> minimize deaths and healthcare costs <br>
-Improve diagnoses through analytics (this is in the field of healthcare analytics) <br>

Steps and Timeline: 

August 2nd (Exploratory Analysis): 
~~Read in the file ~~ 

-Groupby Dates for Timeframes 
-Groupby Symptoms (Common symptoms for various ages)
-Groupby Industry and allergies
-Split the symptoms and create a hierarchical column (value counts)
-Value counts for the symptoms (is the data skewed towards anything) 
-Check the distribution of each variable (including outcomes)
-Range of the reported date and the enter date 
-Check differences between gender
-Check differences with age 
-Make predictions/analyses based on trends that we see in this data
