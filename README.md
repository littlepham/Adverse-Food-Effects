# MIS-381N

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/fda/adverse-food-events

Question: 

What are the highest predictors that lead to an individual's death? 
What are the probabilities of symptoms.


Importance of the Question: 
-Put some statistic about how many people die from food allergies each year or have some major suffering <br>
-Can predict what providers need to look out for in symptoms in like E.R. to take care of those who will probably die first -> minimize deaths and healthcare costs <br>
-Improve diagnoses through analytics (this is in the field of healthcare analytics) <br>
